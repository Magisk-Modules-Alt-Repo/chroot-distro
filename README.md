## Requirements

### Rooted Android Device
All root implementations are compatible.

You can use chroot-distro on any terminal, for example: MiXplorer, MT Manager, Termux, TWRP and Android Terminal Emulator (ADB Shell).

### Busybox for Android NDK
You need a recent version of the "Busybox for Android NDK by osm0sis" Magisk module installed.
* **Recommended:** v1.36.1 is confirmed to work.
* **Avoid:** v1.32.1 is known to cause issues.
* **Important:** Using an outdated version can lead to problems, such as difficulties downloading the rootfs.

### Alternative Busybox
Using the Busybox provided by:
* Magisk/KernelSU/APatch 
(without the "Busybox for Android NDK" module) is supported by the community, but it might introduce bugs during use.

## Android Paths

### System Points
```
/chroot-distro/<distro>
├── /dev
├── /sys
├── /proc
├── /dev/pts
├── /sdcard
└── /storage
```

### Optional Mounts
use `-a` or `--android` flag:
```
├── /system   (Not mounted by default)
└── /data     (Not mounted by default)
```

## Usage Warning

### Notice
chroot-distro requires root access to function. While running as root:
* There's a small possibility of unintended file deletion
* System files could be accidentally modified
* Corner cases might exist despite thorough testing

### Careful
Before running chroot-distro:
* Always backup your important files
* Always backup your system partitions

### Remember
This warning applies to all root-level operations, not just chroot-distro.

As they say: ***With great power comes great responsibility.***

## Commands Usage

### Basic Commands

```
# Show all commands and usage
chroot-distro help

# Display environment details
chroot-distro env

# Show available distributions
chroot-distro list

# Download a new distribution
chroot-distro download <distro>

# Refresh existing distribution
chroot-distro redownload <distro>

# Remove distribution
chroot-distro delete <distro>
```

### Usage Examples
```
chroot-distro download ubuntu
chroot-distro redownload debian
chroot-distro delete ubuntu
```
>*Replace `<distro>` with your chosen distribution identifier*

### Installation Commands
```
# Basic installation
chroot-distro install <distro>
# Install with Android mounts
chroot-distro install --android <distro>

# Reinstall distribution
chroot-distro reinstall <distro>
# Force reinstall with Android mounts
chroot-distro reinstall --android --force <distro>

# Remove distribution
chroot-distro uninstall <distro>
# Force uninstall
chroot-distro uninstall --force <distro>
```
Usage Note:
+ By default, Optional mounts (/data, /system) are not mounted. Use `-a` or `--android` flag to mount them.

+ The reinstall process will stop if files are open or mounts are active. Using `-f` or `--force` will close running processes and unmount active points. For safety, first run without force to see what's running before using the force option.

### Backup Operations
```
# Create backup
chroot-distro backup <distro> [path]
# Remove backup
chroot-distro unbackup <distro>

# Restore backup
chroot-distro restore <distro> [path]
# Restore to defaults
chroot-distro restore --default <distro>
```
Usage Note:
+ Restores backup in its current state. Use `-d` or `--default` to restore original install settings.
+ Optional: Specify custom path to restore from.
+ For old backups: `--force` may be needed, but review first to avoid issues like:
  * System mount conflicts
  * Storage space problems

### Unmount Paths
```
# Unmount system points
chroot-distro unmount <distro>
# Force unmount all points
chroot-distro unmount --force --all <distro>
```
Usage Note:
+ Stops if unmount fails. Use `-f` or `--force` to:
  * Close any process trying to access system points
  * Unmount any active system points forcefully
+ By default: Only unmounts system points
+ Use `-a` or `--all` to unmount everything (system, normal, and loopback mounts)

### Execute Commands
```
# Run specific command
chroot-distro command <distro> "command"

# Login to distro
chroot-distro login <distro>
```
Usage Note:
+ Execute Commands:
   ```
   chroot-distro command <distro> "command"
   ```
   * Runs a command within specified distro
   * Commands must be enclosed in quotes
   * Executes and returns to host system

### Usage Examples
```
chroot-distro download ubuntu
chroot-distro install ubuntu
chroot-distro install --android debian
chroot-distro login ubuntu
chroot-distro command debian "su -l root"

## TODO: How-to Instructions

### Fixing Sudo

By default Android prevents suid usage under `/data` folder. This will prevent using `sudo` inside the rootfs. There is a few alternatives how this can be solved:

1. Quick Remount  
Remount /data for the current process with needed capabilities
```
# Should be executed only once during setup, not on every login!
su -c "mount -o remount,suid /data"
```

2. Image File Method
```
# Create image (adjust size as needed)
su -c truncate -S 15G /data/local/distros.img
su -c mke2fs -t ext4 /data/local/distros.img

# Mount after each reboot
su -c mount /data/local/distros.img /data/local/chroot-distro
```

3. SD Card Method  
https://xdaforums.com/t/mount-ext4-formatted-sd-card.3769344/
```
1. Format SD card with ext4
2. Mount to `/data/local/chroot-distro`
3. Remount after each reboot
```
Overall Note:
- Methods 2 & 3 are safer (prevent accidental command execution)
- SD Card Method advantages:
  - Saves internal storage space
  - Reduces wear on internal storage
  - Extends device lifespan
  - Note: You can't use it for Android stuff (at least by default)

### Desktop Environment with Termux-X11
1. Install Termux-X11  
Download and install Termux-X11 from the official repository:
  https://github.com/termux/termux-x11

2. Install Required Packages in Termux
First, open Termux and run these commands:
```
pkg install x11-repo
pkg install root-repo
pkg install tsu
pkg install ncurses-utils
pkg install termux-x11-nightly
pkg install pulseaudio
pkg install virglrenderer-android
```

3. Set Up Desktop Environment  
(Assuming you have already installed chroot-distro and set up it's chroot environment)  
Inside your chroot environment, Install XFCE4:
```
apt install xfce4

# Optional: Make sure to set up mpd.conf for music/audio server before running 'Audio Server'.
apt install mpd
```

4. Launch the Desktop Environment Easily
![chroot-xfce.sh](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3f5db05f-fdde-40da-aab1-bb754ca98e35)
Note: Make sure to run the script in Termux.

Save this script as "chroot-xfce.sh" as it provides user-friendly menu and use it to launch your XFCE4 desktop environment later:
1. Download the provided code:  
[scripts/chroot-xfce.sh](https://github.com/Magisk-Modules-Alt-Repo/chroot-distro/tree/main/scripts/chroot-xfce.sh)

2. Make it executable:
```
chmod +x chroot-xfce.sh
```

3. Run the script:
```
./chroot-xfce.sh
or
bash chroot-xfce.sh
```

Once completed, you'll have a fully functional XFCE4 desktop environment with audio capabilities running through Termux-X11.

## Development Guide

If you want to help with development or test a bug report against the latest version, create a development build using:

```
zip chroot-distro.zip config.sh module.prop META-INF/com/google/android/* system/bin/chroot-distro
```

Alternative approaches:
- Enable SSH in a distro, update scripts remotely, and test against another distro (no reboot needed thus making the development quicker)
- Develop directly on the device (physically or via remote connection)

Testing requirements:
- Test all changes in Termux (or other terminals) AND Android terminal emulator (ADB Shell)
- Note: ADB Shell only has Busybox and Android Toybox commands, which may behave differently than Termux

Code quality:
- Use `ShellCheck` for POSIX compliance
- Document warning exceptions with `# shellcheck disable=SCXXXX` and explanatory comments
- For shell scripting guidance, refer to [Grymoire's tutorial](https://www.grymoire.com/Unix/Sh.html)
